      <p>Chao Wu(Amanda) is a junior student study in Interaction & Game Design Concentration at Cal State East Bay.</p>

      <p>Before coming to CSU East Bay, I worked as a senior game designer game company in China called Youxigu (游戏谷) which was one of the pioneer Chinese game companies focus in the browser game development.

      Prior to working in an entrepreneurial game company in China which focus on some browser games and social games development.</p>
      <p>My work in these game companies is mainly responsible for designing the gameplay, the design of each feature, and the design of related player trading systems, payment feature, VIP recharge and the reward system based on the genre and characteristics of the game, combined with similar games released on the market.</p>
      <p>As an experienced game designer, I always hold my passion for my professional area and eager to deep forward. That is my most motivation to come here to learn game design. Through learning Game Design, UX Human-centered design and game programming classes, I learn more about the way of thinking by a different perspective. These experiences for my career are invaluable.</p>
      <p>From personal, I am a girl who loves literature and art. Enthusiastic about various literary elements: drama, film, literature, philosophy, history, animation, music and everything about culture and history. Because I strongly believed human culture is the intrinsic expression of content and spirit, and art is the external form of human culture. That is my initial reason to chose a game maker. I want to express the world I imagined through the way of the game.</p>
